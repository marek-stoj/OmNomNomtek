# Non-func requirements

  - Solution reliability, no bugs in scenarios described above
  - Architecture approach - don’t worry about over-engineering too much - we would like to see how you approach a real project. If you think you can make something better, but you don’t have time for it - tell us about it during the interview.
  - Code readability
  - Usage of Zenject or other Dependency Injection framework (not obligatory, but nice to have)
  - Unit tests will be a nice addition
